.. colorbox:: 2018.07.12 Implement Python Annotators GSoC'18: Shingo Kitagawa

    **Introduction**
    
    This project is Google Summer of Code(GSoC) 2018 program by Shingo Kitagawa.
    The GSoC project and proposal page is `here <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/project/4651529278062592/overview>`_.
    
    Two thing below is done in the second period:
    
    * Implement SSD detection annotator with Python library Chainer.

    * Implement FCIS instance segmentation annotator with Python library Chainer.
  
    * Annotate deep learning network output properly. 

    **Approaches**
    
    The project is on progress as the flow below:
    
    1. Run Python code with boost:python and boost:numpy from C++ annotator.
    2. Implement various annotators with Python library Chainer. 
    3. Collect dataset and train models for kitchen task with PR2.
    4. Formatize python template and make build system for Python annotators.
    5. Run kitchen demo with PR2 in the real environment. 
    
    Now, I'm on 3rd and 4th stage of the flow.
    I trained SSD model with `Epic Kitchens Dataset <https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2018>`_,
    but the dataset is captured mainly from first person view
    and contains small variety of object items (`My training repository <https://github.com/knorth55/chainer-epic-kitchens>`_).
    Therefore, I need to train with another dataset for kitchen task.
    I will make a template and build system for python annotators and execute kitchen experiments with PR2.
    
    **Results**

    I implemented SSD detection annotator and FCIS instance segmentation annotator.
    The result are shown as below.
