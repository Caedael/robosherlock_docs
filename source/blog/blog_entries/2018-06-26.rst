.. colorbox:: 2018.06.26 Implement Python Annotators GSoC'18: Shingo Kitagawa

    **Introduction**
    
    This project is Google Summer of Code(GSoC) 2018 program by Shingo Kitagawa.
    The GSoC project and proposal page is `here <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/project/4651529278062592/overview>`_.
    
    Two thing below is done:
    
    * Run Python code with boost:python and boost:numpy from C++ annotator.
    
    * Implement Faster-RCNN annotator with Python library Chainer. 
    
    **Approaches**
    
    The project is on progress as the flow below:
    
    1. Run Python code with boost:python and boost:numpy from C++ annotator.
    2. Implement various annotators with Python library Chainer. 
    3. Collect dataset and train models for kitchen task with PR2.
    4. Formatize python template and make build system for Python annotators.
    5. Run kitchen demo with PR2 in the real environment. 
    
    Now, I'm on the 2nd and 3rd stage of the flow.
    The trained model with VOC dataset is not suitable for kitchen task with PR2,
    so I decided to train new model with kitchen dataset.
    After the training the model, I will make a template and build system for python
    annotators and execute kitchen experiments with PR2.
    
    **Results**
    
    I implemented Faster-RCNN object detection annotator.
    The result is shown as below.
