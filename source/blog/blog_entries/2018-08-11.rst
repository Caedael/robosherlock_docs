.. colorbox:: 2018.08.11 Implement Python Annotators GSoC'18: Shingo Kitagawa

    **Introduction**
    
    This project is Google Summer of Code(GSoC) 2018 program by Shingo Kitagawa.
    The GSoC project and proposal page is `here <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/project/4651529278062592/overview>`_.
    
    Two thing below is done in the second period:
    
    * Implement Mask-RCNN instance segmentation annotator with Python library Chainer.

    * Train various deep learning model with large dataset. 

    This project is completed as GSoC project as belows:
    
    1. Run Python code with boost:python and boost:numpy from C++ annotator.
    2. Implement various annotators with Python library Chainer. 
    3. Train models for kitchen task with large dataset (Epic Kitchen Dataset, COCO).
