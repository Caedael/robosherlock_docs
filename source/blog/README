Guide for adding blog entries:
------------------------------


- entries should be added to the blog_entries folder in a file called YYYY-MM-DD.rst, using the ..colorbox restful command (for an example see existing entries)

- if it's the case, multiple entries can be added to the same file

- media files go in the imgs folder.

- every blog entry needs to be sent as a pull request;
